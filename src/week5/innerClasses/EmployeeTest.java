import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * This program demonstrates the use of an Inner Class in Java to store
 * and manage employee contact information.
 *
 * The outer class `Employee` stores personal details such as the employee's
 * name and surname, while the inner class `ContactInfo` stores contact
 * details such as the mobile phone number and email address.
 *
 * In the `EmployeeTest` class, the program takes user input for both personal
 * and contact information, creates an `Employee` object, and then prints all
 * details using the `print` method.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Demonstrates encapsulation by using an inner class to group related data.
 * - Shows how to initialize and use an inner class instance inside the outer class.
 * - Uses the `Scanner` class to collect data from the user.
